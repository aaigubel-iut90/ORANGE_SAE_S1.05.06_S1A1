    <p class="text">Orange, as a leading player in the sector, wants to help build a more responsible digital world. Orange is committed to achieving net zero carbon by 2040. This involves significant efforts to reduce direct and indirect CO2eq emissions: energy efficiency, renewable energy, circular economy, decarbonization of our value chain, carbon capture. It also means financing carbon sink projects to capture residual emissions. A voluntary roadmap, with first results expected by 2025.<br><br>

    <p>Orange and respect for the environment: a long-term commitment<br>With this first initiative, Orange, true to its purpose, aims to provide its customers with the keys to understanding the impact of their digital usage. More importantly, the group also wants to give them the means to act, with tips and advice.</p><br>
    <p>Orange is actually the first operator to embark on such an initiative for the use of its services. This initiative will be further developed in the coming months.</p><br>
    <p>The goal? To achieve carbon neutrality by 2040, by first reducing all CO2 emissions by at least 30% by 2025. Adapting to the IPCC recommendations and the Paris Agreement is a priority for Orange. This also aligns with Orange’s commitment to more responsible procurement, offering eco-designed products and second-hand network equipment. Second-hand devices will also be sold directly in stores.</p><br>
    <p>The circular economy will therefore be prioritized to achieve the net zero carbon target. Orange is aware that the fight against global warming is crucial. This should no longer be debated by 2020, as it is a key challenge for the future of our planet, which we must all collectively address.</p>

        <h1 style="align-self: flex-start; margin-left: 20px;" id="section2">Fighting Climate Change by Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h1><br>

        <p>Orange is committed to reducing CO2eq emissions on scopes 1, 2, and 3 to become net zero carbon by 2040. The first milestone will be reached in 2025 with a reduction of -30% on scopes 1 and 2 compared to 2015 emissions, and -14% on scope 3 emissions compared to 2018.</p><br>
        <p>The company has set a second milestone in 2030 with a 45% reduction in emissions across all scopes compared to 2020.</p>
        <p>Through this commitment, Orange is doing its part in the global effort defined by the "Paris Agreement" at COP 21 on December 12, 2015. Its primary goal is to keep "the increase in global average temperature well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels" and to continue efforts "to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels."</p><br>
        <p>In recent years, world leaders have emphasized the need to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of this century.</p>
        <p>In this context, we commit to reducing our CO2eq emissions by 90% by 2040 and offsetting the remaining 10% through carbon sequestration in natural carbon sinks.</p>
